<h1>Kottayam </h1>
<p>The royal house had originally been situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. 
It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort.
Afterward, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. 
It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi. Rulers of Munjanad and Thekkumkur had their headquarters at Thazhathangadi in the present Kottayam town. 
Marthanda Varma of Travancore attacked Thekkumkur and destroyed the palace and the Thaliyil fort.
 The remnants of the palaces and forts are still seen here.</p>
